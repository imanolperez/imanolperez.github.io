spinElements
============

This is my submission for js13kGames. The uncompressed version is just 8Kb, and the compressed version is 4kb.

To play the game, rotate the sphere with the arrows, so the 4 elements match. Hey, but there are just 3 elements in the sphere! That's true, and that's because FIRE will hurt you. That's why there's a shield, which you can activate by pressing UP, and this shield will protect you from FIRE and the other elements, if you want to. However, you can use this shield for a limited time, since you will have to load it after.
